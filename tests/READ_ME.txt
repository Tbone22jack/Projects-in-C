Test 1 contains the data and graphs of a limit cycle. Limit cycles oscillate.

Test 2 contains the data and graphs of a stationary state system. Stationary systems converge to steady values of fractional mass.

Data contains a few more graphs that take many systems into account and how changing n affects these systems graphically. It also contains a case where error had a major effect on data.
